# Front-end

This is a source port to [Exoteric.JS](https://github.com/c9fe/exoteric)
of the [React.JS Tic-Tac-Toe example tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) (*using the code at [this codepen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/LyyXgK?editors=)). Only a few lines were changed meaningfully, most were syntactic changes.

The base of this repo was generated from a template for general purpose, 
basic front-end / Node.JS static-server for Exoteric.js.

## Running

Get the repo and...

```shell
$ npm i
$ npm run static
```
